# FizzBuzz

Fizz Buzz is a very simple programming task, asked in software developer job interviews.

A typical round of Fizz Buzz can be:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”.

Example:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...

## Release history

- Release 0.1 - This is the only release (I Think ;)
- Release 0.2 - Some typo fixes and bugs fixes

## Next steps

- Maybe solve other problems typical to interviews in tech jobs using Swift (yes, this is a requirement!)
- If you have one, you can try it yourself, maybe code with me, and maybe we can record a video solving it.
